# beer-model

A shared domain model for the [beer-client](https://github.com/golang-bristol/beer-client) and the [beer-server](https://github.com/golang-bristol/beer-server).

The model currently defines two entities, a Beer and a beer Review.

Note: the only reason for splitting out this model into its own repository was to demonstrate how to include other packages in a golang project using a dependency manager. This package has been included in both the [beer-client](https://github.com/golang-bristol/beer-client) and the [beer-server](https://github.com/golang-bristol/beer-server).
